### [Day 1] Started crafting my first Flutter app

I've got an idea to help myself to learn Dutch. Where to start from? Since I'm a software developer and the solution comes simple - let's build it from scratch.

The initial MVP of my first mobile app took me a couple of evenings and numerous cups of coffee. So, here it is. _(link)_

The main idea is to learn Dutch noun articles. Distinguish which article used where. 'De' or 'Het'.

But it's not usual memoization of words with articles. The app uses spatial memory. Which means you need to swipe the card with a word to the correct direction.
