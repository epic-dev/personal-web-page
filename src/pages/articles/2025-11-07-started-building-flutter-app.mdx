Today I created a screen that displays information about the app. To display the app version, I've included a new Flutter package, `platform_info_plus`. This package allows me to read platform information, as its name suggests, without the need to update it manually on the screen.

One of the key features I think the app needs is "Learning Tips." These tips will appear randomly on each flashcard when a user clicks the light bulb icon.

I also made some small UI enhancements, updating the styling of the settings menu items.
There is still a lot of work to do. A huge part of it is distinguishing which words should be in the Free version and which should be in the Pro version. I need to separate them by category and popularity, or even by common proficiency levels like A1, A2, etc.

To be continued...
